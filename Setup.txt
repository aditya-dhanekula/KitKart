Creating a react application: npx create-react-app
Running a react application: npm start
index.js is the starting point of the application
<App> tag inside index.js will generate the entire application code and the dynamic HTML content is placed inside root which is tied with the div named root in index.html page inside the public folder.
For routing we must install react-router-dom with the following command: npm install react-router-dom
import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom" in app.js
