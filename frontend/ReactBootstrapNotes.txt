For the frontend, we can make use of bootstrap framework to design the components.
With bootstrap framework, we need not design the frontend pages from scratch and this helps in developing cleaner web pages quickly.
We are going to use the react bootstrap package which is the specific bootstrap package for react applications.
React bootstrap uses bootstrap framework to function internally.
Installing bootstrap: npm install bootstrap
Installing react bootstrap: npm install react-bootstrap
In the index.js file import the bootstrap package by adding the import statement: import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
