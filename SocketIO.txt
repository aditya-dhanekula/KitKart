Socket.IO is used for real time bi-directional communication between the client and the server.
Socket.io allows us to build and display admin analysis charts dynamically.
Socket.io also allows us to implement the chat functionality between the user and the admin.
When a user creates an order it will be seen immediately on the admin analytics page without the need to refresh the page.

In order to use socket.io package we need to install two socket.io packages, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

Installing socket.io:
Backend folder command: npm i socket.io@^4.4.1
Frontend folder command: npm i socket.io-client@^4.4.1

Configure server.js in the backend folder in order to use socket.io
